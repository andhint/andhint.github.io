This posts serves as an simple introduction to feature extraction from text to be used for a machine learning model using Python and sci-kit learn. I'm assuming the reader has some experience with sci-kit learn and creating ML models, though it's not entirely necessary. Most machine learning algorithms can't take in straight text, so we will create a matrix of numerical values to represent our text. We'll go over the differences between two common ways of doing this: CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer.

There are a few terms we'll define right off the bat. 
* document - refers to a single piece of text information. This could be a text message, tweet, email, book, lyrics to a song. This is equivalent to one row or observation.
* corpus - a collection of documents. This would be equivalent to a whole data set of rows/observations.
* token - this is a word, phrase, or symbols derived from a document through the process of tokenization. This will happen behind the scenes so we won't need to worry too much about it and for our purposes it essentially means a word. For example the document `'How are you'` would have tokens of `'How'`, `'are'`, and `'you'`

Let's start by defining a corpus of a few different sample text messages.


```python
messages = ["Hey hey hey lets go get lunch today :)",
           "Did you go home?",
           "Hey!!! I need a favor"]
```

            var w = 512;
            var h = 512;
            var numBoxes = 128;
            var boxSize = w / numBoxes;


            var dataset = [];
            for ( var i = 0; i < numBoxes; i++){
                for (var j = 0; j < numBoxes; j++){
                    dataset.push([i, j, Math.random()])
                }

            };
            
            console.log(dataset)


            var bg = "https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/riot-api/img/minimap-ig.png";

            var svg = d3.select('#d3div')
                         .append('svg')
                         .attr('width', w)
                         .attr('height', h);

            svg.append('image')
                .attr('xlink:href', bg)
                .attr('x', '0')
                .attr('y', '0')
                .attr('width', w)
                .attr('height', h);

            svg.selectAll('rect')
               .data(dataset)

               .attr('x', function(d) {
                return d[0] * boxSize ;
                })
               .attr('y', function(d) {
                return d[1] * boxSize;
               })
               .attr('width', boxSize)
               .attr('height', boxSize)
               .attr('opacity', function(d){
                return d[2] ;
               })
               .attr('fill', 'red')
               ;
