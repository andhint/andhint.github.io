This posts serves as an simple introduction to feature extraction from text to be used for a machine learning model using Python and sci-kit learn. I'm assuming the reader has some experience with sci-kit learn and creating ML models, though it's not entirely necessary. Most machine learning algorithms can't take in straight text, so we will create a matrix of numerical values to represent our text. We'll go over the differences between two common ways of doing this: CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer.

There are a few terms we'll define right off the bat. 
* document - refers to a single piece of text information. This could be a text message, tweet, email, book, lyrics to a song. This is equivalent to one row or observation.
* corpus - a collection of documents. This would be equivalent to a whole data set of rows/observations.
* token - this is a word, phrase, or symbols derived from a document through the process of tokenization. This will happen behind the scenes so we won't need to worry too much about it and for our purposes it essentially means a word. For example the document `'How are you'` would have tokens of `'How'`, `'are'`, and `'you'`

Let's start by defining a corpus of a few different sample text messages.


```python
messages = ["Hey hey hey lets go get lunch today :)",
           "Did you go home?",
           "Hey!!! I need a favor"]
```
